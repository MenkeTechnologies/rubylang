# Known gaps

rubylang is in active development. The pipeline (lex → parse → lower to fusevm
bytecode → run) is solid for the implemented surface, verified against the
reference `ruby` by the parity harness (`cargo run --bin parity`, replayed in CI
by `tests/parity.rs`). This file tracks what is deliberately not done yet, so the
gaps are honest rather than surprising. Nothing is faked as working — an
unimplemented method raises `undefined method`.

## Working (for reference)

Classes with `initialize`/`attr_*`/instance methods, single inheritance, `super`
(bare-forwarding and explicit-args), method resolution through the ancestor chain
(own → included modules → superclass), `self`, instance variables, method
chaining; `module` + `include` mixins; class methods (`def self.m`); `begin`/
`rescue`/`ensure`, method-body and statement-modifier `rescue`, `raise` with a
message or an exception class, typed `ZeroDivisionError`/`NoMethodError`/
`ArgumentError`; default arguments; splat parameters (`def f(a, *rest)`); `&:sym`
block-pass (`map(&:upcase)`); keyword arguments (`def f(name:, x: 1)` + `f(name:
"a")`); `%w[]`/`%i[]` word/symbol arrays; operator method definitions (`def +`,
`def <=>`, `def [](i)`) and `Comparable` (`< > <= >= == between?` derived from
`<=>`); block comparators (`sort { |a, b| … }`, `min`/`max` with a block);
call-site/array/target splat (`f(*a)`, `[1, *a]`, `a, *b = …`); parallel
assignment (`a, b = 1, 2`, swap); `case`/`when Class`
(`when Integer`) and `is_a?`; `sprintf`/`format`/`String#%` with width/precision
flags; a broad Enumerable/Hash surface (`partition`, `group_by`, `tally`, `zip`,
`each_with_object`, `transform_values`, …); blocks/`yield`/closures with lexical
capture, `&block` params + `block_given?`/`__method__`, lambdas (`->(x) { }`,
`.call`/`.()`/`[]`), keyword args + `**opts`, `Integer#step`, `?c` char literals,
`String#center`/`tr`/`lines`/`delete`/`count`/`to_i(base)`, `Integer#to_s(base)`,
`Array#dig`/`first(n)`/`last(n)`/`min(n)`/`max(n)`/`each_cons`/`sum { }`,
`Hash#dig`.

## Language

- **`extend` / `prepend` / `class << self`.** Only `include` and `def self.m` are
  modeled; other mixin/singleton forms are not. `super` resolves through the
  superclass chain (module-`super` ordering is approximate).
- **Class-body statements** run at definition time with `self` bound to the
  class, so `def`, `attr_*`, `include`, class variables (`@@x = 0`), constants,
  and other executable statements all take effect. (Constants are stored
  globally rather than namespaced under the class.)
- **Paren-less keyword args** (`greet name: "x"`) are not parsed.
- **Numeric literal / method binding.** `-7.abs` parses as `-(7.abs)` (operator
  precedence) rather than `(-7).abs`; MRI treats `-7` as a literal. Use
  `(-7).abs`.
- **Expression-level modifier `rescue`.** `x = expr rescue fallback` binds the
  rescue at statement level (`(x = expr) rescue fallback`) rather than MRI's
  `x = (expr rescue fallback)`. A standalone `stmt rescue stmt` works.

## Lexer

- **Not lexed:** `__END__`. Heredocs (`<<END`, `<<~SQL`, `<<-EOT`, `<<'RAW'`),
  `%w[]` / `%i[]` word/symbol arrays (and the `()`/`{}`/`<>` delimiter variants),
  double-quoted `#{}` interpolation, `?c` character literals, and regex literals
  (`/pat/flags`, with `i`/`m`/`x` flags) **are** lexed.

## Runtime / methods

- **Regexp.** Supported: `/pat/flags` literals, `=~`/`!~`, `String#match`
  (returns `MatchData` with `[n]`/`pre_match`/`post_match`/`to_a`/`captures`),
  `match?`, `scan`, `split(re)`, `sub`/`gsub` with a Regexp (backrefs `\1`..`\9`
  in the replacement and a block form), and `Regexp#{source,match,scan,match?}`
  plus `case`/`when /re/` case-equality. A successful match sets the globals
  `$~` (MatchData), `$&` (whole match), `` $` ``/`$'` (pre/post text), `$+`
  (last group), and `$1`..`$9` (numbered groups) — visible after `=~`/`match`
  and inside a `sub`/`gsub` block. (The punctuation globals `` $` `` and `$'`
  can't yet appear inside a `#{...}` interpolation — the interp scanner reads the
  quote as a string delimiter; reference them outside interpolation.) Backed by
  the Rust `regex` crate, so Ruby's Onigmo-only constructs (backreferences within
  the pattern, lookaround) are unavailable.
- **`Object#class` returns a String** (the class name), not a `Class` object;
  `.class.name` and class-object identity are therefore unsupported.
- **Enumerator without block.** `each_with_index.map` (an enumerator returned
  from a block-less call) is not supported. (`&:sym` block-pass IS.)
- **Bignum.** Integers auto-promote to arbitrary precision on overflow, like
  MRI: values that fit stay `i64` immediates, and only the overflow path
  allocates a `BigInt` heap object (backed by `num-bigint`). Arithmetic, bit
  ops, `**`, comparison, `to_s(base)`, `bit_length`, and `digits` all cross the
  boundary transparently.
- **`rand`.** Seeded from the system clock (no `srand` determinism yet).
- **Method surface.** The Enumerable/String/Hash/Range surface is broad but not
  exhaustive; an unimplemented method raises `undefined method '<name>'`.
- **Pattern matching (`case/in`).** Array/hash/find-by-key patterns, class
  patterns (`Integer`, `Point[...]`), variable/`_` binding, `=> name`, `^pin`,
  `|` alternatives, `*rest` splats, and `if`/`unless` guards work. Not yet: the
  two-sided find pattern (`[*, x, *]`), `**nil` exact-key enforcement, and
  variable bindings *inside* an `|` alternative.

## Tooling

- **DAP stepping.** The adapter completes the initialize/launch handshake and
  runs the program to completion with stdout capture, but breakpoints and
  stepping are not wired yet.
- **AOP weave.** The method-intercept registry (`src/intercepts.rs`) matches and
  stores advice, but the dispatch loop does not yet fire it — the fast path stays
  fast until the feature is turned on explicitly.
